Dear Lab Designers,

Please format the lab code properly, at least with IntelliJ IDEA's formatting feature.

Please use a proper Java coding convention: use PascalCase for class names, camelCase for field names.

Otherwise, this will be the worst _Software Engineering_ practice that I've ever seen.

Best,  
Harry
